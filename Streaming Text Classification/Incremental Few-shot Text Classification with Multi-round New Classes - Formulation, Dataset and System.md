This paper, titled "Incremental Few-shot Text Classification with Multi-round New Classes," addresses a novel problem in natural language processing (NLP), namely, **incremental few-shot text classification**. The key challenge the authors aim to solve is how to handle the classification of text into an increasing number of categories over time, with only a few examples available for each new class. Here’s a breakdown of the paper’s core contributions and methods:

### 1. **Research Problem**
   - **Objective**: The goal is to develop a system that can classify text by learning new categories in an incremental manner, round by round, without relying on large amounts of labeled data and without retraining on previous data.
   - **Challenges**: The system must (i) **learn new classes incrementally** without forgetting previous ones (avoiding catastrophic forgetting) and (ii) **maintain good performance** on both new and old classes with very limited data per new class (few-shot learning).

### 2. **Approach**
   The authors propose **two methods** to address the problem:
   
   - **ENTAILMENT**: This method casts the text classification problem as one of **textual entailment**. The idea is that classifying an input (e.g., a user query) into a category is equivalent to determining if the input "entails" a given class label. For example, if the input is "I lost my card," and the class label is "Report a lost card," the system checks if the class label is true given the input. This method uses **pre-trained entailment models** (like RoBERTa) to leverage large-scale textual entailment datasets.
   - **HYBRID**: This method combines the **entailment approach** with a previous method called **Discriminative Nearest Neighbor Classifier (DNNC)**, which focuses on finding if two text inputs belong to the same class. HYBRID takes advantage of both entailment and DNNC for improved performance.

### 3. **Benchmark Datasets**
   The paper introduces **two new datasets**:
   
   - **IFS-INTENT**: Focuses on **intent detection**, like understanding a user's intent in customer service (e.g., "get physical card").
   - **IFS-RELATION**: A dataset for **relation classification**, which determines the relationship between two entities in a sentence (e.g., subject-predicate-object relations).

   Both datasets simulate a real-world scenario where new classes are introduced in **five rounds**. Each round contains new classes with only a few labeled examples.

### 4. **Evaluation Metrics and Experimental Setup**
   - The system’s performance is tested in **two settings**: (i) **without base classes**, meaning the system starts from scratch and learns incrementally, and (ii) **with base classes**, where the system is pre-trained on a set of initial categories.
   - **Metrics**: Accuracy is used for measuring how well the system can classify new and existing classes. For out-of-distribution (OOD) classes (i.e., inputs that don’t belong to any known class), F1 score is used to check how well the system can reject incorrect labels.
   
   Additionally, the paper discusses **catastrophic forgetting**, where the model may forget previously learned classes as it is updated with new ones. The **performance drop rate** is used to evaluate how much accuracy decreases over time as new classes are introduced.

### 5. **Results and Findings**
   - **ENTAILMENT** and **HYBRID** models significantly outperform baseline models, especially when there are no base classes to rely on.
   - When base classes are available, both **ENTAILMENT** and **HYBRID** maintain strong performance across multiple rounds of new classes, showing that their method can incrementally learn without significant loss in accuracy on older classes.
   - The **HYBRID model** performs best overall, especially in scenarios with no base classes, as it benefits from combining both entailment and nearest-neighbor techniques.

### 6. **Conclusion**
   The paper proposes a novel task for NLP and provides two effective methods for solving the incremental few-shot classification problem. It also introduces benchmark datasets that can be used for future research. The **ENTAILMENT** approach, which uses large-scale textual entailment data, shows promising results for scenarios where labeled data is scarce.

### Technical Breakdown:
1. **Models**: The models are based on **RoBERTa**, a transformer-based model, used to encode the input and class labels for the entailment task.
2. **Training**: Models are pre-trained on **large-scale entailment datasets** like the **MNLI dataset** and then fine-tuned on the few-shot examples of the new classes.
3. **Inference**: At test time, the system generates entailment pairs by pairing the input text with all possible class labels, scoring each pair to decide the most likely label.

This work is important because it addresses real-world constraints like continuously evolving categories (e.g., in customer service systems) and limited data, making it highly applicable in domains where data collection and annotation are expensive or slow.
