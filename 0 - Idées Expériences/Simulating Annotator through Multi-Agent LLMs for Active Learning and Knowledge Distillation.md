## Motivation
The development of high-performing machine learning models is often bottlenecked by the availability of labeled data, which traditionally relies on human annotators. This approach is not only costly and time-consuming but also poses challenges in consistency and scalability. With the advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a unique opportunity to simulate annotators through Multi-Agent systems. Such an approach can revolutionize Active Learning by providing immediate, high-quality annotations, and facilitate Knowledge Distillation by generating diverse and informative data representations. By leveraging the collective knowledge embedded in LLMs, we can address the pressing needs of rapid model development, adaptability to new domains, and reduction of biases, all while optimizing resources and maintaining data privacy.


### **Reducing Computational Resources**

**Idea**: Utilize smaller, well-trained models and adaptive decoding strategies to generate chain-of-thoughts (CoT), aiming to reduce computational requirements without sacrificing performance.

**Experimental Plan**:

- **Model Selection**: Choose smaller LLMs (e.g., DistilGPT-2, BERT variants) that are pre-trained and fine-tuned on relevant datasets.
    
- **Adaptive Decoding Strategies**: Implement adaptive decoding methods such as CoT-decoding or nucleus sampling with adjusted parameters to maintain generation quality.
    
- **Performance Comparison**: Compare the quality of generated examples and the student model's performance when using smaller models versus large LLMs.
    
- **Resource Monitoring**: Record computational metrics such as GPU/CPU usage, memory consumption, and inference time to quantify resource savings.
    
- **Human Evaluation**: Conduct a human evaluation of the generated examples to ensure that reduced computational resources do not compromise data quality.
